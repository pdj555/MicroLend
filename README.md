# MicroLend - React Native Loan Request App (Work in Progress)

MicroLend is a mobile application being developed using React Native that aims to allow users to request small loans from either their friends or qualified individuals worldwide. The app utilizes a pre-determined model to calculate the interest for loans less than $1,000, providing users with an estimate of potential costs before making a loan request.

Please note that the project is currently in its early stages of development, and not all features are implemented yet. We are actively working on building the app and adding new functionalities.

## Features (Planned)

- User Registration and Authentication: Users will be able to create accounts, log in, and securely access their loan history.

- Loan Request: Users can submit loan requests and specify the desired loan amount.

- Loan Calculation: For loan amounts below $1,000, the app will employ a pre-determined model to estimate the potential interest based on qualified lenders.

- Friends or Global Lenders: Users will have the option to request loans from their friends or from individuals considered qualified to lend globally.

- Loan History: Users can view their previous loan requests and the corresponding interest rates.

- User Rating: After a successful loan transaction, both borrowers and lenders will have the option to rate each other based on their experience. This rating system will help build trust within the community and identify reliable borrowers and lenders.

- Instant Money Transfer: When both parties agree on the loan terms, the money will be instantly transferred from the lender's account to the borrower's account. This feature aims to provide a seamless and efficient experience for both parties.

- Notifications: Users will receive notifications when their loan request is accepted, the money transfer is completed, and when they receive ratings from other users.

- Account Management: Users can update their profile information and view their account details.
